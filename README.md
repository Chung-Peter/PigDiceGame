# Pig Dice Game

Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1. [from Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)]

* Player 1 starts first.
* Click "Roll Dice" as many times as you'd like.
  * Whatever you roll will be added to the current score.
  * To keep your current score and add it to your total, click "Hold".
  * However, if you roll a '1' you forfeit the current score and your turn ends.
* First person with a total score of 100 wins.

This was my second JavaScript project while going through the course: The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!

The "index.html", "style.css", and PNG files were provided by the instructor but all of the code in "script.js" is my own.

I got the game running and then refactored the code to make it DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
